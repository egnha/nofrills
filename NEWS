# nofrills 0.1.0.9000

* `..()`, an alias of `fn()`, is softly deprecated.

* `fn()` now comprehends literal unquoting operators via the use of `QUQ()`,
  `QUQS()` and `QUQE()`. This allows you to make functions with `fn()` that
  contain unquoting operators, which is handy when programming with dplyr or
  other tidyverse packages.

* Added `abbrev_fn_args()`, a functional operator that “upgrades” a function to
  one that can interpret abbreviated function expressions (cf. `as_fn()`)

# nofrills 0.1.0

* Initial release
